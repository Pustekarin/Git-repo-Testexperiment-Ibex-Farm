<h3>Welcome!</h3>
<p>
You have been invited to take part in this experiment because you are a native speaker of either English, German or Polish. If you are a native speaker of Polish or German you should have a good knowledge of English since the following experiment will be carried out in English.
<h4>Instructions</h4>
This is a sentence reading experiment using a method called "self-paced reading". In this experiment you will be required to read a number of English sentences one word at a time. You can advance to the next
word by pressing the <b>space bar</b>.
</p>
<p>
Your task is to read the sentences as quickly as possible without rushing through them. Your understanding of the content will be checked with comprehension questions, so please pay attention to what you are reading. Please do not pause while you are reading a sentence. The computer will record the reaction time for each time you press the space bar. You may take a break in between sentences if you wish so. After each sentence you will be shown the message "Press space bar to continue". Only then will you be shown the next sentence.
